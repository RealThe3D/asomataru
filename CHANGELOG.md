## v3.0
Long due, Asomataru v3 is here!

### ‚ùå Removed features
And as said back in 2021, RPG has been removed. I don't have the time to implement it. Sorry.

Some commands were also removed:

- **Baka**: API removed baka gif.
- **Blackjack**: Gambling didn't feel right in Asomataru.
- **Feed**: It was a weird command.
- **Neko**: It was a weird command.
- **Version**: Asomataru's internal version isn't particularly necessary for most people.
- **Eval (OWNER ONLY)**: I don't really need this anymore.
- **Restart (OWNER ONLY)**: I don't really need this anymore.
- **Prefix**: Discord uses slash commands now, so prefixes have been removed.

- **Anime**: Displays an anime and its info as you search, and with autocorrect!
- **Time**: Displays the current time

## Asomataru v2.0

### 2.6

**Asomataru 2.6 | Prelude V3 Update!**

**_Prelude update for Asomataru v3!_**

Many commands were refactored to be embedded or faster! `blackjack` - New
command, can bet a price to win coins! `hug` - fixed issue where it said kissed
instead of hugged.

**RPG is getting removed in v3.**

- I haven't really did anything to the rpg aspect of Asomataru in over a year.
  It's just too complex for me to maintain. I really wish I had more knowledge
  to finish it, but I will leave it at a dead end.

**V3.0 Sneak Peek!**

- Slash Commands will be added.
- Even more new commands!
- Rewriting the bot from JavaScript to TypeScript to prevent less errors for
  this update.
- Button and Replys added!
- Discord.js v13 support!
- Node.js v16 support!
- Many, many, more visual changes to the bot.

**This update may take all the way till January of 2022 to launch.**

### 2.5

Asomataru v2.5! Finally, at last.

- Asomataru v2.5 is finally out! After 3 months of doing nothing, it has finally
  rolled out!

Reasons for the long delay.

- School has the took a big toll on how much time I could spend on Asomataru,
  but it's summertime so now I can push updates like crazy like how it used to
  be with Asomataru v1!

NEW CATEGORY: FUN

- I split the General category into 2 categories, with the fun commands being in
  the fun category!!! This helps out with organization.

NEW COMMANDS feed, poke, slap, hug has joined the party. All affect your
affection in different ways!

OPTIMIZATIONS

- Asomataru is a bit smarter and faster now.

MISCELLANEOUS

- We use axios instead of superagent for api calls, because, why not?

PREVIEW FOR v2.6

- Slash Commands! Will be added before 2022.
- More things to do on our website!!
- More micro-optimizations!!!
- Hopefully, the entire RPG will be finished (Will be v3.0)

### v2.4

Asomataru v2.4! Quality of Life Update! Huge Recode!

- Asomataru has gotten a huge recode, similar to the one of v2.0 back in August
  of last year.

INTERCHANGEABLE PREFIX

- At last, Asomataru now has a interchangeable prefix! Change the prefix using
  prefix , you won't regret it!

NO MORE DATABASE RESETS In the earlier versions of Asomataru, adding something
new to the database required the existing data to be wiped. Now, it will no
longer do that!

Other HUGE changes!

avatar, userinfo, ban, and kick - Now accept user IDs, now you don't have to ping a person and get them ANGRY.
